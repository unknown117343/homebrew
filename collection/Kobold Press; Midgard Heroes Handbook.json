The undead will keep at the task until it's completed or until 28 days have elapsed.

Vættir usually awake with an indifferent attitude; disagreeable, but not outright hostile. If the Vættir is not persuaded to help or is offended, it's likely to attack. It may cast {@spell bestow curse} or {@spell geas} on you, or rise from its mound to demand tribute, or physically attack you and any associates nearby. At no time during this process is the Vættir under your control. The ritual simply gets it to listen to you, but it makes its own decisions.",

				"First, a body must be constructed for the tupilak from the body parts of recently-dead animals and children. The body is wrapped in seaweed or vines and then encased in an outer shell made from bone treated with icy unguents and sealing salves worth 3,000 gp. The body can't be animated until a tupilak idol (with a material cost of 2,500 gp) is inserted, to serve as its heart. The verbal component is an ancient, hours-long song of revenge, sung over the construct's body during each night's ritual. This construction process consumes nine consecutive nights with a 9-hour ritual each night.",
				"The final ritual captures a hungry spirit of Ginnungagap to animate the construct. These spirits are vengeful and mercenary; many intended victims of tupilaks have saved their own lives by figuring out how to turn a resentful, murderous construct against its creator."

Both varieties can be called upon by descendants and those who live nearby for aid, although there's always a price. A vættir's 'help' is often more than the asker bargained for."
