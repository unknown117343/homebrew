					"Bearfolk are massive people of iron resolve and deep nobility, resembling bears that walk upright rather than all fours. Hailing from either the cold climates of Midgard's Northlands or from a nation of light carved out of the Shadow Realm itself, bearfolk put their trust in family and tribe to stand against the world. In defiance of their brutish appearance, they are deeply spiritual and artistic.",
					{
						"type": "entries",
						"name": "Fearsome and Strong",
						"entries": [
							"Bearfolk are broad-shouldered, bipedal humanoids. Although they strongly resemble upright bears, they have longer legs than any bear and their massive hands are more like a human's hand than a bear's paw. They lack the bear's sharp claws, but they're as dextrous as any human craftsman's. Their muscles develop early in life, and most bearfolk look it. Their physiques tend toward great bulk beneath shaggy fur. Even the slenderest bearfolk are quite strong. Bearfolk are over 7 feet tall when they stand at their full height, but they often appear shorter because of a natural forward roll to their shoulders. They weigh between 250 and 350 pounds.",
							"They're covered in shaggy fur that can have a range of colors. The most common colors are black and brown, often with a lighter frosting or tip on the chest, shoulders, and upper back. Coppery red, honey-colored, and even pure white fur occur rarely. The color gives a clue to the particular bearfolk's heritage, but it's not an exact indicator. As they age, bearfolk tend to go silvery around the muzzle, giving them a distinguished look."
						]
					},
					{
						"type": "entries",
						"name": "Tribe and Family",
						"entries": [
							"The core of bearfolk society is the immediate family. Parents care for their cubs until the young reach the age of 5 or 6 years, when a precocious shift takes over. Although they aren't yet fully grown, the cubs are drawn by a powerful urge to explore. They begin spending time away from their family, treating their entire village (or smaller neighborhood in a larger settlement) as a sort of extended family. This can be surprising or even annoying for nonbearfolk neighbors, who might discover a bearfolk child rooting through their pantry for a snack, inviting itself to dinner, or even adopting them as its new family temporarily. This isn't necessarily as inconvenient as it sounds, since young bearfolk are also more enthusiastic learners and harder workers around the house than most other children their age.",
							"Beyond immediate family, the tribe forms the majority of bearfolk culture. Once bearfolk cubs start venturing beyond their own homes, families intertwine. Each cares for the cubs that happen by that day, welcoming the wayward children to meal tables as their own. There's no choice but to know one's neighbors in a bearfolk tribe, and that brings them all closer together. Trade apprenticeships and budding talents are identified early thanks to this intermingling, and it helps find a suitable niche for a young bearfolk's path in life.",
							"Elders are highly respected for their experience and greater perspective, but practicality carries weight as well. Being old doesn't afford one unlimited leeway if one makes questionable decisions or has a reputation for foolishness. Building on this respect, bearfolk venerate their ancestors at a nearly demigod level and believe the spirits of their ancestors guide them. The tribe also holds druids and clerics (particularly those that serve nature deities) in high respect and looks to them for guidance."
						]
					},
					{
						"type": "entries",
						"name": "Home and Honor",
						"entries": [
							"When establishing homes, bearfolk gravitate toward striking a balance with nature and their impact on it. Even the most urban-minded of them prefer parks and greenery, and take pains not to disrupt the surrounding countryside any more than necessary. Where possible, they love to incorporate existing caves and rock formations into their architecture. Settlements always hold a totem, statue, or some other representation honoring an ancestor of virtue at their center.",
							"The bearfolk place a high value on honesty, trust, hard work, and community. These are the virtues that bring a bearfolk honor, and the same attributes make an outsider welcome. Laws governing bearfolk life are simple and loose. They trust in their core values to guide them wisely when disputes arise. In the rare instance when a disagreement can't be settled according to custom, honor, and common sense, the elders become involved. Defying the judgment of elders for personal gain is a source of great shame that can ruin a bearfolk in the eyes of his or her tribe and family."

					{
						"type": "entries",

							"Their intimidating mien is no veneer. Bearfolk have a deep and impressive capacity for violence when roused to anger or in defense of their own. Bearfolk passions run as strong as their bodies, and banter that pushes the boundary into insults and bruised honor often leads to more bruises. Their great physical strength means they excel at battle, and even relatively minor physical altercations can inadvertently become serious. Many bearfolk wear scars from physical contests, both simple competition and more serious matters of wounded honor, that went a little too far.",
							"Thanks to their physical prowess, many bearfolk follow the path of the warrior. Barbarians and fighters are common, with rangers and druids following closely.",
							"When bearfolk go to war, they do so with the clear goal of protecting their people in the moment and in the future. If that means the destruction of a foe, then so be it. They are adept at weaving their talents together in the same manner they blend families into tribes. Spellcasters favor turning the natural world against their foes with conjured beasts and manipulating battlefield conditions through weather, controlling plants, and even shaping the earth itself."

					"On the plains, in the forests, and across the steppes live creatures who blend humanoid and equine aspects. Centaurs are neither man nor beast, but occupy a strange niche in both the civilized and natural worlds. They are born with grace befitting a human king, but are possessed of the fierce savagery of a wild stallion. Centaurs are a scattered race, roaming in small clan groups from the Rothenian Plain (where their numbers are great) to the court of the young Valeran Emperor, whom several serve as personal guards. But they also have a reputation for banditry and bullying, and most cultures consider them dangerous. Centaurs are largely a nomadic people. Their archery is excellent and their healing arts are well advanced. Because they have little interest in magic or in writing, other cultures sometimes disregard centaurs, but they do so at their peril. Large centaur hordes have smashed baronies and even small nations flat.",

							"Upon reaching the age of majority, all young adult centaurs embark on their “bandit years,” a practice designed to siphon off those who are particularly troublesome and give some experience to more agreeable colts and fillies. These young centaurs run free, away from the clan groups, to exorcise their aggression and immaturity. At the end of this period, they can choose to remain outside their clan or horde, or they can return with the understanding that they have tamed their wild ways — at least to the degree that's acceptable to centaur society.",
							"Most young adults choose to return after their bandit years, though the occasional centaur leaves the horde permanently out of curiosity, romance with another race, or any number of other factors. Young centaurs of the same age go on their bandit years together, with instructions from the clan chief about when they'll be allowed to return.",
							"Centaurs believe in personal property, but they also believe that a person who claims to own something should be strong enough to defend it. They never steal from their clan, but anyone else is fair game. Shipments or supplies of grain and alcohol are their favorite targets.",
							"During a raid, centaurs take advantage of their speed, maneuverability, and skill in archery. They use diversions to draw defenders away from targets, or use heavy volumes of arrows to keep them pinned down.",
							"The bandit years are the time when centaurs drink most heavily. Within the clan, celebrations can be shockingly raucous, but everyday life is not. During the bandit years, however, young centaurs are drunk more often than not. This constant inebriation fuels more raids, fights, and reckless behavior.",
							"The bandit years are also the time when centaurs are most likely to take up a life of adventuring, even if only for a little while. Many centaurs spend their bandit years not strictly as bandits but as wanderers and adventurers, eventually returning to their clans with loot and stories."

They are great miners, good gearsmiths, and modest alchemists, and they have a curiosity about the world that frequently gets them into trouble. They are merchants to both the surface world and the world beneath it, with their greatest cities hidden deep below the earth. Their enemies are the diabolical gnomes, the dwarves, and any other mining races that seek dominance of dark, rich territories.",

Here, kobolds carry themselves upright, see themselves as naturally superior to the hairy races, and swagger about their business.

In many cases, a kobold “adopts” an adventuring party as new clutch-mates.",

Mining picks, a mason's hammer, jeweler's loupe, and even simple items like a kobold's spear or dagger are all named and cherished. At the same time, kobolds tend to gnaw on tool handles, forget to oil blades, or even pry out inlays or decorative gems (to polish or reshape them) without first considering how they'll repair the damage.

These can be anything the kobold likes the sound of, and often come from another culture; some kobolds are partial to dwarven names, for example, mainly for ironic reasons. Alternatively, they can take descriptive labels, usually with an incongruous gravitas or a ridiculous implication of power, such as Worldshaker, Thor Giantslayer, or Spinecrusher.

The little creatures often inhabit the fringes of human society, scraping a living as petty thieves and tricksters. Many make their homes in decrepit slum tenements, in disused dockside warehouses, or even in sewers and other warrens beneath the city streets. Some, particularly in the Southlands, live a nomadic existence, wandering from place to place and trading in whatever odds and ends they acquire along the way, through honest means or otherwise. Other groups can be found on small tropical islands in the Tethys Ocean.",

Many of Zobeck's ratfolk are loyal servants of the Free City's infamous Mouse King\u2014picking pockets, burgling mansions, and smuggling goods up and down the Argent River on behalf of their monarch. Others serve any powerful figure as scouts, saboteurs, and infiltrators on their master's behalf. Whoever their master may be, ratfolk are loyal to their kin.",

The feathers became ravenfolk, and they spread across the world as Wotan’s spies.",

The Tsar of Vidim employs a great flock of huginn as his personal spies and assassins.",

That’s not to say they don’t lie; ravenfolk lie as much as anyone else, and maybe a bit more when the pressure’s on. But if a promise or a vow can be extracted from one, it’s as reliable as gold—which may be why ravenfolk seldom make promises or vows. Otherwise, their personalities are as varied as those of other races. They adapt readily to whatever environment they occupy, from remote wilderness to big cities—although their presence in cities is not always welcome. They frequently take on local customs, traditions, and beliefs to fit in with the community."

When choosing human-friendly names, ravenfolk borrow liberally from local traditions, mythology, and popular songs and poetry. They prefer names that invoke imagery (Starshadow, Moonglow, Rainshimmer) over more prosaic labels, but that’s as much consistency as it’s possible to define. Furthermore, since these aren’t their real names, ravenfolk have little attachment to them. They swap names whenever they feel like it, until they finally settle on one that really suits them."

The most prevalent story recounts that the shadow fey were elves who made pacts with forces of darkness millennia ago, most likely during the Sorceress’s Revolt when a group of beleaguered elves turned to those powers out of desperation. The official history of the Shadow Courts assumes this version of events is true, and the Shadow Reckoning (SR) calendar begins at that time. Sarastra, the Queen of Night and Magic, is featured as both the divine patron and the founder of the shadow fey in this tale, a fact she is pleased to exploit when it suits her.",

The Queen of Night and Magic existed long before the once-elven princess Sarastra came to rule the shadow fey, and stories of their exploits reach back centuries prior to the Sorceress’s Revolt. Indeed, many shadow fey seem more closely related to other fey races than to elves, despite the relatively short span of time since their supposed separation.",
							"Mentions of alternate planes, chaos, and time magic—particularly in the environs of Zobeck and Castle Shadowcrag—contribute to the confusion. In the end, only the gods know the true origin of the shadow fey. Speculation is rampant but not often shared. As is commonly said in the Summer Court, it is unwise to argue with a goddess.

Your griffon is a fierce and loyal steed, forming a lifelong bond with you and fighting to protect you in battle. Use the standard griffon stats, but each time your proficiency bonus increases (at 5th level, 9th level, etc.), add +1 to your griffon's AC, saving throws, and attack bonus, and increase its maximum hit points by 10.",

It moves and acts as you direct it, with just three action options (Dash, Disengage, and Dodge). If you want the griffon to attack, you must use your action to command the griffon to do so; this allows it to use the Attack action as a reaction on your turn. Once you gain the Extra Attack feature, you can make a weapon attack yourself in addition to ordering your griffon to attack.",

This typically takes around 30 days, but this period can be longer or shorter, at the GM's discretion. Importantly, griffon knights who are given a replacement mount are expected to provide a viable griffon egg to the Order in return."
