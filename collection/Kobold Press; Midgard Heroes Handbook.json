You must be related to the creature, must have lived nearby for at least a year, or must have a relative of the creature present at the ritual of their own free will. Entreaties can raise the vaettir from their barrows to protect, bestow blessings, or remove curses. The vaettir, however, are greedy and demanding allies. They're also difficult to send away once roused, requiring a successful Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) contest at the least, bribery or even a sacrifice at the most; the specific price is determined by the GM.",
				"The ritual summons an undead creature from beneath the earth. Typically, a {@creature vaettir|MidgardHeroes} ({@creature vaettir|ToB|Tome of Beasts}) is summoned, but sometimes other undead answer the call, depending on the nature of the ancestor interred. You can ask the creature to perform one task, such as defending you against attack, bestowing or removing a curse, retrieving a stolen object, avenging an insult, providing information, or a similar favor. The undead will keep at the task until it's completed or until 28 days have elapsed. The task must be within the undead's power to accomplish or it simply ignores the request and returns to its repose. For example, a vaettir can't journey to the elemental planes to retrieve something.",
				"Persuading the vaettir to undertake the task requires explaining why you need it done and how it also benefits the vaettir to help—blood relations are strong motivators here—followed by a successful Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) contest opposed by the vaettir's Charisma (or a {@skill Deception} contest if the caster lies). Vaettir usually awake with an indifferent attitude; disagreeable, but not outright hostile. If the vaettir is not persuaded to help or is offended, it's likely to attack. It may cast {@spell bestow curse} or {@spell geas} on you, or rise from its mound to demand tribute, or physically attack you and any associates nearby. At no time during this process is the vaettir under your control. The ritual simply gets it to listen to you, but it makes its own decisions.",
				"The creature typically returns to its barrow or grave when the task is done and it's collected its payment, tribute, or praise. If anything has been stolen during its absence, it's certain to seek recompense or revenge against the person who called it out."
